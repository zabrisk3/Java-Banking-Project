# JavaBankingProject

This is a bank simulation using Java that was done to experiment with class inheritance and protected fields. 
There is a general Account class, and two subclasses, CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount. SavingsAccount implements a 
yearly compound interest function, while CheckingAccount implements a withdrawl function.
